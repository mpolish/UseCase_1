I need a readme file, to describe functionality of an ASP.NET WEb app application, that has 1 endpoint, which retrieves a list of countries. I can pass a params for filtering by name and population, sort by name in descending and ascending, and paginate (if I pass a 15, it will retrieve only first 15 countries from the list)

I need 2 paragraphs, 4-10 Sentences, at least 10 example URLs of how to use API
